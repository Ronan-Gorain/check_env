copy cfg.dist to cfg and update connection infos

Exemple to check an env named "test-upgrade" and created on dev cluster:
/check_env.sh -e test-upgrade

Exemple to check an env named "test-prod" and created on prod cluster:
/check_env.sh prod -e test-prod

This script meant to check recently created environments as it won't work well if catalina logs have been rotated since last start

To avoid screen flooding, catalina errors are truncated and limited

It clearly need to be improved
